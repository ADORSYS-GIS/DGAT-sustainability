# Implementation Plan - Offline-First Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for transforming the DGAT Sustainability Tool into a complete offline-first application. The plan is divided into 5 phases, each building upon the previous one.

---

## Phase 1: Enhanced IndexedDB Schema (Foundation)
**Priority: HIGH** | **Estimated Time: 2-3 days**

### Purpose
Establish the complete database foundation that will store all application data locally and enable offline-first operations.

### What We're Building
- Complete IndexedDB schema with all required object stores
- Proper indexing for efficient queries
- Version tracking for conflict resolution
- Data models and types

### Files to Create/Modify
1. **`frontend/src/services/indexeddb.ts`** - Complete rewrite
2. **`frontend/src/types/offline.ts`** - New file for enhanced types
3. **`frontend/src/services/dbMigration.ts`** - New file for migrations

### New Object Stores to Add
- `categories` - For category management
- `users` - For user management (org admin)
- `organizations` - For organization data
- `submissions` - For submission tracking
- `reports` - For report data
- `sync_status` - For sync state tracking
- `network_status` - For network state persistence

### Success Criteria
- Database version 2 with all stores implemented
- Proper indexing for efficient queries
- Version tracking for all data entities
- Migration from version 1 to 2 working correctly

---

## Phase 2: Initial Data Loading Service
**Priority: HIGH** | **Estimated Time: 2-3 days**

### Purpose
Ensure that all necessary data is loaded into IndexedDB when users log in, enabling complete offline functionality.

### What We're Building
- Role-based data loading (org admin vs regular user)
- Progress indicators during loading
- Error handling and retry logic
- Data validation after loading

### Files to Create/Modify
1. **`frontend/src/hooks/useInitialDataLoad.ts`** - Role-based loading
2. **`frontend/src/services/dataValidator.ts`** - New file for validation

### Data Loading Strategy
**For Organization Admins:**
- All questions and categories
- All assessments in their organization
- All users in their organization
- All submissions and reports
- Organization data

**For Regular Users:**
- All questions and categories
- Their own assessments
- Their submissions
- Assessment templates

### Success Criteria
- All necessary data loaded on login
- Progress indicators showing loading status
- Error recovery for failed loads
- Data validation ensuring integrity

---

## Phase 3: Request Interceptor Layer ⭐
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Estimated Time: 3-4 days**

### Purpose
Create a transparent layer that automatically routes all data requests through IndexedDB first, providing seamless offline-first behavior.

### What We're Building
- Automatic API call interception
- Transparent offline-first routing
- Local-first UI updates
- Automatic queue management

### Step 3.1: API Interceptor
**Files to Create:**
1. **`frontend/src/services/apiInterceptor.ts`** - New file

**What It Does:**
- Intercepts all API calls automatically
- Routes GET requests through IndexedDB first
- Routes mutations through local storage and queue
- Provides transparent offline-first behavior

### Step 3.2: Component Integration ⭐⭐⭐
**Files to Modify: ALL COMPONENT FILES**

**This is where we change all pages to fetch from IndexedDB instead of remotely!**

#### Admin Pages to Update:
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ManageQuestions.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ManageUsers.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ManageOrganizations.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ManageCategories.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ReviewAssessments.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/StandardRecommendations.tsx`

#### User Pages to Update:
- `frontend/src/pages/user/Dashboard.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/user/Assessments.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/user/Assesment.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/user/ActionPlan.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/user/SubmissionView.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/user/OrgUserManageUsers.tsx`

#### What Changes in Each Component:
1. **Replace API calls with IndexedDB reads**
   ```typescript
   // OLD: Direct API call
   const { data } = useQuestionsServiceGetQuestions();
   
   // NEW: IndexedDB read
   const { data } = useOfflineQuestions();
   ```

2. **Implement local-first UI updates**
   ```typescript
   // OLD: Wait for API response
   if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
   
   // NEW: Show local data immediately
   const localData = await offlineDB.getAllQuestions();
   setData(localData);
   ```

3. **Add offline status indicators**
   ```typescript
   const { isOnline } = useSyncStatus();
   if (!isOnline) {
     return <OfflineIndicator />;
   }
   ```

4. **Queue mutations for background sync**
   ```typescript
   // OLD: Direct API mutation
   const mutation = useQuestionsServicePostQuestions();
   
   // NEW: Offline-first mutation
   const mutation = useOfflineMutation({
     mutationFn: createQuestion,
     localMutationFn: saveQuestionLocally,
     queueForSync: true
   });
   ```

### Success Criteria
- All components read from IndexedDB first
- UI updates immediately with local data
- Mutations are queued for background sync
- Offline status is clearly indicated
- No direct API calls in components

## Phase 4: Enhanced Sync Service
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Estimated Time: 2-3 days**

### Purpose
Provide reliable background synchronization with robust error handling, retry logic, and conflict resolution.

### What We're Building
- Advanced queue management with retry logic
- Exponential backoff for failed operations
- Priority handling for critical operations
- Last-write-wins conflict resolution

### Files to Create/Modify
1. **`frontend/src/services/syncService.ts`** - Enhanced queue management
2. **`frontend/src/services/conflictResolver.ts`** - New file

### Enhanced Features

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Conflict resolution working correctly
- Comprehensive error handling

---

## Phase 5: Status Management
**Priority: LOW** | **Estimated Time: 1-2 days**

### Purpose
Provide clear user feedback about sync status, network connectivity, and system health.

### What We're Building
- Enhanced status tracking
- Progress indicators for sync operations
- Detailed status information
- Manual sync controls

### Files to Modify
1. **`frontend/src/hooks/shared/useSyncStatus.ts`** - Enhanced tracking
2. **`frontend/src/components/shared/SyncStatusIndicator.tsx`** - Better UI
