## Core Components

### 1. Enhanced IndexedDB Schema

#### Data Storage Strategy
The offline database will store all essential data types required for the sustainability assessment tool. This includes core assessment data such as questions and categories, user-specific data like assessments and responses, and organizational data for administrators including users, organizations, submissions, and reports.

The database structure is designed with proper indexing to ensure fast queries and efficient data retrieval. Each data type has specific indexes based on common query patterns, such as filtering assessments by user or organization, or finding responses for a specific assessment.

#### Sync Queue Management
The sync queue is a critical component that manages all pending operations that need to be synchronized with the server. Each queue item contains detailed information about the operation type, the data being modified, and metadata for retry logic and conflict resolution.

The queue system implements a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle temporary network failures. Failed operations are automatically retried with increasing delays, and operations that exceed the maximum retry count are moved to a separate failed items list for manual review.

### 2. Request Interceptor Layer

#### Operation Flow Strategy
The request interceptor acts as a middleware that intercepts all API calls and routes them through the offline-first strategy. For read operations, the system first checks the local database and returns data immediately, then optionally updates the local cache with fresh data from the server if the user is online.

For write operations, the system immediately stores the data locally and provides instant feedback to the user. The operation is then queued for synchronization with the server when connectivity is available. This approach ensures that users never experience delays due to network issues.

#### Component Integration
All React components are modified to read data directly from the local database instead of making direct API calls. This ensures consistent behavior regardless of network status and provides a seamless user experience. The interceptor layer handles the complexity of data synchronization transparently.

### 3. Background Sync Service

#### Network Monitoring
The sync service continuously monitors network connectivity using multiple detection methods. It listens for browser online/offline events and also performs periodic connectivity checks to ensure accurate status detection. The service maintains detailed logs of network status changes for debugging and analytics.

#### Queue Processing Strategy
When the network becomes available, the sync service automatically processes all pending queue items. The processing follows a first-in-first-out order with priority handling for critical operations. Each operation is processed individually with proper error handling and retry logic.

The service provides real-time feedback about sync progress and handles various error scenarios gracefully. Failed operations are automatically retried with exponential backoff, and persistent failures are logged for manual intervention.

#### Conflict Resolution Framework
The system implements a last-write-wins conflict resolution strategy based on server timestamps. When conflicts are detected, the server version takes precedence, ensuring data consistency across all devices. The conflict resolution process is transparent to users and maintains data integrity.

### 4. Status Management

#### Network Status Tracking
The system maintains detailed information about network connectivity, including connection type, last online timestamp, and connection quality metrics. This information is used for optimizing sync strategies and providing accurate status feedback to users.

#### Sync Status Monitoring
Real-time sync status tracking provides users with immediate feedback about the synchronization process. The system tracks pending operations, failed items, sync progress, and overall system health. This information is displayed through various UI components to keep users informed.
