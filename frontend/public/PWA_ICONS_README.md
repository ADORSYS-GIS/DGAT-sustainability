# PWA Icons Required

The following PWA icons need to be created for the application to work properly as a PWA:

## Required Icons

1. **icon-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG
- **Background**: Should match the theme color (#10b981)
- **Content**: Should represent the sustainability assessment tool
- **Design**: Simple, recognizable icon that works at small sizes

## Suggested Design

- Green background (#10b981)
- White or light-colored sustainability symbol (leaf, recycling symbol, or assessment checklist)
- Clean, minimal design that's readable at small sizes

## How to Create

1. Use any image editor (Figma, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
2. Create a 512x512 canvas with green background
3. Add a white sustainability-related icon in the center
4. Export as PNG
5. Resize to create 192x192 version
6. Place both files in the `frontend/public/` directory

## Alternative

You can use online PWA icon generators:

## Current Status

❌ icon-192x192.png - Missing
❌ icon-512x512.png - Missing

Until these icons are created, the PWA installation may not work properly in some browsers.
